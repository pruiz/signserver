DEVELOP
------

This file contains instructions needed for building and developing
SignServer.


Checking out from Subversion      
----------------------------

After checking out from	SVN you	need to	run any of the Ant targets for the
workspace to recognize if it is	the Community or Enterprise Edition:
$ bin/ant init

This will copy some files into the right location as well as creating the
res/edition.properties file to flag that this has been done.


After checking out the project there will be errors in the IDE because some 
source files (i.e. Web Services stubs) has not been generated yet. Those errors 
will disappear after configuring and building SignServer.

See also the Developers page of the SignServer Wiki for the latest guidelines,
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/signserver/index.php?title=Developers or 
click the Wiki link on http://www.signserver.org.



Building
--------

Maven is used for building the sources.

Note 1:
Before Maven version 3.2.3, plugins and artifacts were fetched from the Central 
Repository over insecure HTTP. Make sure to edit your ~/.m2/settings.xml to
override the URL of Maven Central. See doc/sample-maven-settings.xml for an
example.

Note 2:
Some of our dependencies (and Maven plugins) are not yet in Central but are
available in PrimeKey's internal repository as well as under lib/ext.
To have this dependencies installed there is a script to run:
$ ./modules/maven-manually-install-deps.sh

To build using Maven from the command line use for instance:
$ mvn install

This will build all of the SignServer modules, putting the artifacts under
./lib/ and the SignServer/DeployTools module descriptors in ./mods-available.


Eclipse
-------


To build successfully using Eclipse, there are .classpath and .project files in
the package and in the source code repository.
Checkout SignServer either using the Subversion CLI or as a project in Eclipse.
Simply check out SignServer as projects and you are almost set. 
Web service stubs for test classes are generated when the tests are built. To 
get rid of all build errors in Eclipse you need to build classes and tests: 
$ bin/ant clean build test:compile
Then do a Refresh and Clean and Build in the IDE.


NetBeans IDE
------------
Open the Maven projects directly in the IDE.

NetBeans IDE 8.0 is recommended with one exception:
The SignServer AdminGUI uses the Swing Application Framework and requires 
NetBeans IDE =7.0.x for changing some of the GUI parts.


Eclipse
-------
Each SignServer subproject is an Maven project. Open or import it to Eclipse
as done for any Maven project.
TODO: This is currently untested.


Writing Documentation
---------------------
The SignServer documentation is built by maven-site-plugin using Doxia from 
xdoc (XML) source files under modules/SignServer-Doc and are then placed
in ./doc/htdocs as well as included in the SignServer-Doc-web.war.


Automated Tests
---------------
SignServer uses JUnit for automated testing. Test cases exists in multiple 
projects. 

Unit tests are run when building with Maven unless -DskipTests is specifed.
System tests are placed in JAR files and can later be run with Ant:
$ bin/ant systemtest:jars

This is roughly how tests are currently organized:
* Each new module can include its own Unit tests.
* Some components (i.e. web services) uses their own test projects 
  (SignServer-Test-*WS) to not have to include client-side code in their 
  projects.
* Legacy tests and system tests are placed in SignServer-Test-System.

See also the "Testing" chapter of the manual for the prerequisites and 
instructions for how to run the tests. 


Test coverage with Clover
-------------------------

To run Clover, copy the Clover installation folder (or make a symlink to it) 
and store it as lib/ext/clover-dir. If the project has been built already an 
dummy Clover folder will already exist with that name so you will have to 
remove it first.

$ bin/ant clean clover.clean build deploy
$ bin/ant ant test:run

Stop the application server and then run the following to gather the report:
$ ant clover.xml clover.html

To disable Clover even if it is installed run Ant with -Dno.clover=true.


Admin GUI Development
---------------------
The SignServer AdminGUI is implemented using the Swing Application Framework 
(JSR 296) and requires NetBeans IDE 7.0 if you want to do GUI changes. Since 
JSR 296 didn't make it into the JDK, support for it was dropped in later 
versions of the IDE.


Code Conventions
----------------

We are loosely trying to follow the old Sun/Oracle Code Conventions for the 
Java TM Programming Language:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html

Some of the rules:
- The code should be properly indented
- We use spaces (not tabs) for indention, the IDE:s can be configured to use this
- Opening curly braces ("{") should not be on there own line. Example "if (true) {"
- First sentence in JavaDoc ends with a period ".". Example /** The signature algorithm. */
- TODO: Add more here
