                <p>
The SignServer administration command line interface (Admin CLI) is started
using bin/signserver (or bin/signserver.cmd).
                </p>
                <p>
Every worker is identified by an ID and an optional name that can be used in all
the CLI commands.
                </p>
                <p>
It is possible to do configuration of a worker while it's in production. All
configuration commands are cached until a reload command is issued and the
configuration becomes active.
                </p>
                <p>
There is a special property file for the cli interface called signserver_cli.properties defining which nodes that exists in the cluster. The properties are:
                </p>
                <p>
<b>hostname.masternode</b> = Should only contain one of the nodes, specified as the default master node. Used by operations dealing with the database and where not all nodes in the cluster needs to be contacted. It is possible to override this setting in the CLI by using the -host &lt;host name&gt; parameter.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>hostname.allnodes</b> = Should contain all the nodes in the cluster, separated by a ';'. Mainly used by the commands getStatus, activateCryptoToken and deactivateCryptoToken.
                </p>
                <p>
Its possible to customize the CLI with your own code. How to do this is described in the development section.

<b>getstatus:</b>
Returns the status of the given worker, it says if its crypto token is active or not and the loaded 'active' configuration. It is possible to get a <i>brief</i> summary or a <i>complete</i> listing for one worker or all configured workers. If all workers are displayed will also all the global configuration parameters be displayed.

                        <p>
<b>importcertificatechain:</b>
Used to import a certificate chain into a crypto token. It takes a worker ID of the crypto worker
(or a worker ID of a worker with the crypto token configured in the legacy way)
and a path pointing to a file containing the certificate chain and a key alias to import to.
This is currently supported by the PKCS11 and keystore crypto token implementations.

                        <p>
<b>activatecryptotoken:</b>
Used to activate crypto tokens. Authentication code is usually the PIN used to unlock the keys on the HSM. Not used if the token is set to auto-activation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
<b>deactivatecryptotoken:</b>

                    <h4>SignServer Specific Commands</h4>
                        <p><b>Authorization Related</b></p>
                        <p>
These commands are used to configure the internal client certificate authorization when it is turned on. It controls which clients that is authorized to request a processable worker.
                        </p>
                        <p>
<b>addauthorizedclient:</b>
Adds a client certificate to a processable workers list of acceptable clients using this worker. Specify
certificate serial number in hex and the Issuer DN of the client certificate.
If DN components contains commas, these needs to be escaped with backslashes.
Alternatively a certificate file (PEM or DER format) can be specified,
from which the serial number and issuer DN is fetched.
                        </p>
                        <p>

<b>listauthorizedclients:</b>
Displays the current list of acceptable clients.
                        </p>
                        <p>
<b>renewsigner:</b>
Sends a request for renewal of the specified worker to the specified renewal worker. If the authcode parameter is omitted the command prompts for the password.
See also the section about the <a href="complete.en.html#RenewalWorker">RenewalWorker</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Database Related</b></p>
                        <p>
<b>resync:</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
The 'resync' command is used after a SignServer had a complete database failure. When this happens  will the Global Configuration become in 'Off-line' mode and it's not possible for the nodes to communicate internally and the Global Configurations will not be in sync any more. After the database is up again can this command be sent to the node that have the most valid Global Configuration and write it to the database. After this will the Global Configuration be in 'On-line' mode again.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Archive Related</b></p>
                        <p>
This commands can be used for processable workers that have archiving turned on. They 
are used to find specific archived responses. It's up to the implementation of the 
worker if it supports archiving or not and it is up to the chosen Archiver if it 
archives the data in way that it can be queried using this commands. For Archivers 
other than the default "OldDatabaseArchiver" and Base64DatabaseArchiver querying 
might have to be done directly in a database, filesystem or by some custom 
application.
                        </p>
                        <p>
<b>archive findfromarchiveid:</b>

                        </p>
                        <p>
The Id depends on the worker, in case of the TSA is the TimeStampInfo serial number used.
The data is stored with the same file title as the archive id and with the file extension 
depending on the type of item, for instance ".request" or ".response".

                <subsection name="Database CLI">
                    <div class="frame note">
                        <div class="label">Note</div>
                        <div class="content">This is a SignServer Enterprise Edition (EE) feature.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
The SignServer Database CLI uses Java Persistence API (JPA) to connect to the 
SignServer database. The CLI is configured by the dbcli.* properties in 
signserver_cli.properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The CLI needs to have the JDBC driver of the selected database available on the 
classpath. This can be achieved by setting the OPTIONAL_CLASSPATH environment 
variable when calling the bin/signserver-db script or by putting the JAR under
lib/ext/jdbc/ and calling it jdbc.jar. The last method is required to be able 
to run the JUnit tests. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
Sample usage:
                    </p>
                    <source>
bin/signserver-db audit
                    </source>
                    
                    <h4>Verify Auditlog Command</h4>
                        <source>
Usage: verifylog -all
       verifylog [-node NODENAME[:OFFSET] ...]

Verifies logs from all nodes starting at sequence number 0 or only from the specified nodes and optional sequence number offsets specified.
If the nodename is suffixed with a colon and an number then the verification for that node is started from that sequence number.
The JDBC connector of the database might have to be put on the classpath. See the example below.

Example: a) signserver-db audit verifylog -all
Example: b) signserver-db audit verifylog -node server1 -node server2:708
Example: c) OPTIONAL_CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar signserver-db audit verifylog -all
                        </source>
                        <p>
The command can be run to verify the signature of every entry in the auditlog 
as well as checking the sequence number in order to make sure that it does not 
contain any gaps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
The keys used to verify the log are configured in conf/databaseprotection.properties.
                        </p>

                    <h4>Archiving of the audit log</h4>
                        <p>
As the Database CLI audit verifylog command checks for gabs in the sequence numbering entries from the audit log can not be archived/moved to other storage without special care.
However since the command now supports the option to specify from which sequence number to start the verification the following scheme for archiving is proposed:                            
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
Run the command to verify the complete log audit log:
<pre class="code">audit verifylog -all</pre>
Note down the last sequence number for each node. Ie:
<pre class="code">Last sequences: {server1=2, server2=7}</pre>
                            </li>
                            <li>
All entries from 0 up to the entry before the last can now be archived and removed from the database. In our example that would be entry 0 and 1 for node server1 and entries from 0 to 6 for node server2.                                
                            </li>
                            <li>
The next time the log should be verified start the verification from the last sequence numbers:
<pre class="code">audit verifylog -node server1:2 -node server2:7</pre>
Again note down the last sequence number for each node and all entries up to the sequence number before the last for each node can now be archived.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <div class="frame note">
                            <div class="label">Note</div>
                            <div class="content">It is important to not remove the row with the last sequence number for any node as if the application is restarted the sequence numbering would than start again from 0 for that node.</div>

                <subsection name="Administration GUI">
                    <p>
As a complement to the command line interface there is also a graphical user
interface for managing some of the most basic administrative tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The SignServer AdminGUI is built by default (unless the property admingui.enabled is set to the value "false" in signserver_deploy.properties),
and can be started using the script bin/signserver-gui.
                    </p>
                    <p>
On startup, the connect to SignServer dialog offers the possibility to either
connect to a locally running SignServer instance or a remote one over web
services. If the "-ws" command line option is specified the later option is
already selected when the dialog opens.

First select either to connect to a local or remote instance. If a remote one
is selected then also specify URL to SignServer server as well as keystore and
truststore for setting up the HTTPS connection.
Then click the button <b>Connect</b>.
By clicking the button <b>Load defaults</b> the settings from
the file default_connect.properties is loaded. The current settings are stored 
to connect.properties and displayed the next time the dialog is openned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
<b>Connect to</b>: Select to either connect to a "Local SignServer" using the

                        <p>
<b>Truststore Type</b>: Type of the truststore. Should match the choosen
truststore file (if any). Options are: "Use keystore", JKS, PKCS12 or PEM. If
"Use keystore" is choosen the trusted certificates are instead taken from the
keystore and no truststore is used.
                        </p>
                        <p>
<b>Truststore file path</b>: Path to the truststore file (if any).

The SignServer Administration GUI main window consists of a menu bar, a toolbar,
the working area and at the bottom a status bar. The working area constists of a
left and right part where the left is a list of all configured workers and the
right shows details for the selected workers (if any).

<b> File -&gt; Add Worker/Load Configuration…</b>: Opens the dialog to import a configuration or set-up a worker manually by specifying worker parameters. When selecting "Load from file" it is possible to load a configuration file. This is equivalent of the "setproperties" <a href="complete.en.html#Administration%20CLI">Admin CLI</a> command. Selecting "Add worker" enables setting up a worker from scratch by manually specifying a worker ID (the default selected will generate an ID dynamically), worker name, fully qualified class name for the implementation, and (optionally) a signer token implementation. Additional properties can be added using the table below. When the required parameters are given, the "Next" button will enable moving to the next step where additional manual editing of the resulting configuration can be made (the format is the same as the worker properties files). Clicking the "Apply" button from this stage will load the current configuration. The dialog can be dismissed in both states using the "Cancel" button.

Allows adding webservice administrators, auditors, and archive auditors.
The administrators can be added by explicitly entering the client certificate's
serial number in hexadecimal (leading zeroes and letter case is not significant)
and the issuer DN with space after each comma separating DN components.
If DN components contains commas, these needs to be escaped with backslashes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
An example using a certificate issued from EJBCA with the default (as specified by EJBCA) LDAP DN order:
                        </p>
<source>
C=SE, O=TestOrganization, CN=IssuingCA
</source>
                        <p>
This is the reversed order compared to how the issuer DN is stored in the certificate.

An example using a certificate issued from EJBCA with the Use LDAP DN order option disabled:
                        </p>
<source>
CN=ReverseIssuingCA, O=TestOrganization, C=SE
</source>
                        <p>
Alternatively a certificate file can be loaded, from which the serial number and issuer DN will be taken.

Test keys for all the listed workers. It is optional to either test the current
key or the next key (if any) or all the keys in the keystore. For this to work
all workers should have the same password. The results shows for each key the
key alias, SUCCESS and the public key hash if the test signing succeded.

can be selected. It is also possible to manually enter a value in the field to
generate a CSR for a specific key alias in the crypto token.
Signature algorithm, subject distingueshed name (DN) and Filename must be 
specified if not already taken from the worker's configuration. The format of 
the request could either be a Standard CSR file or a CSR wrapped in PKCS#7/CMS 
signed object created by a RequestSigner. The with the last option is that at 
the CA the signature of the request can be verified.

                        <p>
At least one of "Signer certificate" and "Signer certificate chain" columns needs to be filled in.
If a file is chosen for "Signer certificate" then the first certificate from that file will be used as signer certificate. It will also be added to the beginning of the certificate chain (if it is not already there).
If a file is chosen for "Signer certificate chain" then all of the certificates from that file will be included in the certificate chain. The first certificate will be used as signer certificate (if a "Signer certificate" was not chosen).
                        </p>
                        <p>
If the "Install in token" check box is selected, the certificate chain will be
imported to the worker's crypto token (if the crypto token supports this operation).
When this is selected, the key alias to import the chain to in the token can
be manually entered in the key column. This is currently only supported for
keystore and PKCS11 crypto tokens.

Requests a Renewal worker to renew all the choosen and selected workers. The 
Renewal worker will generate a new key if there isn't already a next key available 
and then contact EJBCA using its web service interface to request a new certificate.
After recieving the new certificate it is installed and the next key becomes 
the current default key. Notice how the "Not valid after" date and possibly also
the Signings column changes and the Renewal checkbox gets unchecked after a
successfull renewal.

If the "Allow any aministrator with a valid certificate" is checked all 
administrators are given access even if they are not present in the list. This 
is for instance useful when first setting up the system. After adding your 
administrators the checkbox can be unchecked. It is recommended to add your self 
using the "Load current" button to be sure the correct information is filled in 
before disabling access for admins not in the list.

<b>IPv6 dualstack can give permission denied when trying to connect from AdminGUI</b>:<br/>

                                <p>
The card prompts for the PIN but then doesn't ask for which certificate to login with.
Instead an error message with the text "Received fatal alert: bad_certificate" is displayed.
This error message indicates that the server did not accept the provided certificate (ie, the issuer was not in the server's truststore). However, in this case the error could be because no certificate was possible to read from the card.
This has been observed with some type of smart cards.

                <subsection name="Working with Workers">
                    <p>
In SignServer operations are performed by workers. There can be many workers 
and each worker has its own configuration. Each worker is identified by an unique 
ID. A worker can also be configured with a name by setting the property NAME. 
After the configuration has been activated (by issuing reload with the worker ID) 
that name can also be used to address the worker.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Configuring</h4>
                        <p>
A worker is configured by setting properties for it. Specifically if the plugin
is built-in it is specified by setting the property CLASSPATH to the fully
qualified name of the class implementing the plugin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
The properties can be set manually using the setproperty command or by loading
them all at once from a configuration file using the setproperties command.
Sample configuration files are available in SIGNSERVER_HOME/sample-configs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
To setup a PDFSigner using the quick start configuration file issue the
following command:
                        </p>
                        <source>
bin/signserver setproperties sample-configs/qs_pdfsigner_configuration.properties
                        </source>
                        <p>
Notice the created workerId and use it when applying the configuration using the
reload command:
                        </p>
                        <source>
bin/signserver reload WORKER-ID
                        </source>

                    <h4>Remove Workers</h4>
                    <p>
                    You can list which workers you have with the command:
                    </p>
                    <source>
bin/signserver getstatus brief all                    
                    </source>
                    <p>
                    If will display for example:

            <section name="Making the SignServer highly-available">
                <p>
Here are some tips on configuration used to make the SignServer redundant. Usually is the SignServer set-up with three nodes (required minimum for MySQL cluster) where one node is a management node from were all deployment and administration is done and the other two services are service nodes processing the actual requests.
                </p>
                
                <subsection name="HTTP access requires a load balancer">
                    <p>
HTTP based workers like the TSA can be clustered using a load balancer accessing a health check servlet returning the state of the SignServer. The basic settings of the health check servlet can be configured in the build configuration file but more advanced settings are done in 'src/web/healthcheck/WEB-INF/web.xml'. With the default settings will the servlet return the text 'ALLOK' when accessing the URL http://localhost:8080/signserver/healthcheck/signserverhealth. If something is wrong with the sign server will an error message be sent back instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The health check servlet can also be used to monitor the SignServer by creating a script that monitors the URL periodically for error messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Tip, heartbeat with ldirectord is a good solution for a load balancer and works well with the SignServer. KeepAlived is another open source solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The Main WebService using the Java client API manages the HA parts itself and then isn't a load balancer necessary.

                <subsection name="Setting up a MySQL Cluster">
                    <p>
The database backed of the SignServer can be made redundant using MySQL Cluster. Details on how to set-up the MySQL cluster can be found in the document <a href="../docs/SignServer_3_0_Installation_Guide.pdf">SignServer_3_0_Installation_Guide.pdf</a> that can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.signserver.org">www.signserver.org</a>.

               <subsection name="Healthcheck">
                   <h4>Setting up the Health check servlet</h4>
                    <p>
In SignServer there exists a health check service that can be used for health monitoring. It is also useful for cluster, as it can be checked by load balancers to determine if a node should be active in the cluster (healthy) or taken out of the cluster (unhealthy).
                    </p>
                    <p>
The servlet is located at the URL: http://localhost:8080/signserver/healthcheck/signserverhealth and configured in signserver_deploy.properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The following configuration parameters may be set to configure authorization and what the service checks: 
                    </p>
                    <p>
<source>healthcheck.authorizedips</source> - A semicolon-delimited list of IP addresses authorized to access
the healthcheck servlet, if the list contains the keyword "ANY", any IP address is authorized access (defaults to <source>127.0.0.1</source>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
<source>healthcheck.minimumfreememory</source> - Number of megabytes of memory that must be free before removing     
the node out of the cluster (defaults to 1).
                    </p>
                    <p>
<source>healthcheck.checkdbstring</source> - The string that should be used to do 
a minimal check that the database is working. May differ between databases.
(defaults to <source>Select count(*) from signerconfigdata</source>, the property is not used when running without database).
                    </p>
                    <p>
<source>healthcheck.maintenancefile</source> - The path to a file containing the maintenance state, this file is a
standard Java property file and should have a property (by default named <source>DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</source>").
If this property has the value <source>true</source>, none of the standard health checks will be performed, and instead
the result will be a string of the form <source>MAINT: DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</source>.
If this property is not set (or an invalid file is given), the maintenance functionallity is disabled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
<source>healthcheck.maintenancepropertyname</source> - The property name to be used in the maintenance file. This will also
affect the error message returned when in maintenance mode (the part of the string after <source>MAINT: </source>
(defaults to <source>DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</source>).
                    </p>
                
                <h4>Available tests and responses</h4>

                            <p>
<b>Down for maintenance</b><br/>
If the down for maintenance file indicates that the server is down for maintenance an HTTP response code in 5xx range is returned with an error page containing "MAINT: " followed of the name of the maintenance property as configured. No further checks are performed.
                            </p>

                            <p>
<b>Database test</b><br/>
A test is performed that SignServer is able to query the database. When running without database a check is made that the configured directory is initialized correctly and is not empty. If anything failed one or more error messages are included in an error page returned with the HTTP response code in the 5xx range.
