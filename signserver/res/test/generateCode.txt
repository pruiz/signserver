The generateCode.js script can be used to generate a (large) C file to produce
very large binaries for testing the MS Authenticode signer with large inputs.
The script needs GJS to be installed (this should be available in most GNU/Linux
distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora among others).
To run the script:

$ ./generateCode.js <number of lines> > output.c

Each line will contribute with 20 bytes to the size of the resulting executable.

To compile the binary, use MingW gcc.
The package to be installed is called gcc-mingw-w64 on Debian/Ubuntu.
To compile a generated C source:

$ x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -o output.exe output.c
